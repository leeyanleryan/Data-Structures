## Singly Linked List

The singly linked list (SLL) comprises of nodes. The nodes contain a value and point to the next node in the SLL. The SLL has two pointers: the head and the tail. The head points to the node at index 0, the first element of the SLL. The tail points to the node at index length-1, the last element of the SLL.
